# weather-station-V1

Simple weather monitoring station.

Uses BMP-280 to log temperature + pressure and DHT-22 to log temperature + relative humidity.

Sensors are connected to NodeMcu ESP-32 (wiring.jpg).

The ESP logs data once every 5 minutes, connects to WiFi and sends POST request to google scripts app with the collected data.
After that, ESP goes into deep sleep and wakes up after 5 minutes to repeat the whole loop again.

The Google-Apps-Script web app handles the POST request and saves the received data to google sheets.

The collected data and relevant graphs are here:
